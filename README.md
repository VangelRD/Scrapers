## 📦 Installation

1. Make sure you have Go installed (version 1.21 or higher)
2. Clone or download this repository
3. Navigate to the project directory
4. Build the scraper:

```bash
go build -o comick-scraper main.go
```

## 🎯 Usage

The scraper supports three modes with **massive parallel processing**:

### 1. Full Download (Download All Manhwas)

Downloads all available manhwas and their chapters from comick.live:

```bash
./comick-scraper -mode=full
```

**Performance**: Completes in approximately **1 hour** thanks to parallel processing of 100 pages simultaneously.

### 2. Download Specific Manhwa by Slug

Download all chapters for a specific manhwa using its slug:

```bash
./comick-scraper -mode=slug -slug=the-mad-dog-of-the-duke-s-estate
```

To find a manhwa's slug, check its URL on comick.live. For example:
- URL: `https://comick.live/comic/the-mad-dog-of-the-duke-s-estate`
- Slug: `the-mad-dog-of-the-duke-s-estate`

### 3. Download Manhwas After Specific ID

Download all manhwas that have an ID greater than or equal to the specified ID:

```bash
./comick-scraper -mode=after-id -start-id=1000
```

This is useful for resuming downloads or only getting newer manhwas.

## ⚙️ Configuration Options

### Concurrent Workers

Control the number of concurrent download workers (default: 20, max: 50):

```bash
./comick-scraper -mode=slug -slug=your-manhwa -workers=30
```

**Optimization**: The scraper automatically uses:
- **100 parallel page fetchers** for manhwa discovery
- **10 parallel manhwa processors** 
- **5 parallel chapter processors** per manhwa
- **Your specified workers** for image downloads

## 📁 Download Structure

Downloads are organized in the following structure:

```
downloads/
├── manhwa-slug-1/
│   ├── cover.webp          ← Cover image
│   ├── chapter_1/
│   │   ├── 000.webp
│   │   ├── 001.webp
│   │   └── ...
│   ├── chapter_2/
│   │   ├── 000.webp
│   │   ├── 001.webp
│   │   └── ...
│   └── ...
├── manhwa-slug-2/
│   ├── cover.webp
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

## 📋 Examples

### Download a single manhwa with high performance:
```bash
./comick-scraper -mode=slug -slug=solo-leveling -workers=30
```

### Download all manhwas with maximum speed:
```bash
./comick-scraper -mode=full -workers=50
```

### Resume downloading from manhwa ID 500:
```bash
./comick-scraper -mode=after-id -start-id=500 -workers=25
```

## 🔧 Technical Details

The scraper uses **advanced parallel processing** and follows the optimized API pattern:

### Parallel Page Discovery
1. **Parallel Manhwa List Fetching**: Processes 100 pages of `/api/search?page=N` simultaneously
2. **Speed**: ~25 pages/second vs 1.5 pages/second sequential

### Smart Chapter Discovery
1. **Paginated Chapter Lists**: Uses `/api/comics/[SLUG]/chapter-list?page=N` when needed
2. **Complete Discovery**: Finds ALL chapters across multiple pages (e.g., 661 chapters vs 60)
3. **3 Consecutive 404s Logic**: Efficiently detects pagination end

### Optimized Image Extraction
1. **Direct HTML Parsing**: Eliminated wasteful API endpoint testing
2. **Pattern Matching**: Extracts image hashes from escaped JSON in HTML
3. **CDN Downloads**: `cdn1.comicknew.pictures/[SLUG]/0_[CHAPTER]/en/[HASH]/[N].webp`

### Parallel Processing Architecture
```
Page Discovery:    [100 concurrent pages]
    ↓
Manhwa Processing: [10 concurrent manhwas]
    ↓
Chapter Processing: [5 concurrent chapters per manhwa]
    ↓
Image Downloads:   [20+ concurrent images per chapter]
```

## ⚖️ Legal Notice

This tool is for educational purposes only. Please respect comick.live's terms of service and use responsibly. The scraper includes built-in rate limiting to be server-friendly.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **"Permission denied" errors**: Make sure the scraper has write permissions in the current directory
2. **"Too many open files" error**: Reduce workers with `-workers=20`
3. **Server rate limiting**: The scraper auto-adjusts but you may need to reduce `-workers`
4. **Disk space**: Each manhwa can be several hundred MB to GB in size
5. **Network timeouts**: The scraper retries automatically with fast timeout recovery

### Finding Manhwa Slugs:

Visit comick.live and navigate to any manhwa. The slug is the last part of the URL:
- `https://comick.live/comic/tower-of-god` → slug: `tower-of-god`
- `https://comick.live/comic/one-piece` → slug: `one-piece`

### Performance Tuning:

- **For speed**: Use `-workers=30-50` with good internet
- **For stability**: Use `-workers=10-20` for slower connections  
- **For servers**: The scraper auto-manages rate limiting
